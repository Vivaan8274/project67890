            <p>Football is my favourite hobby. It’s a team
sport, in which you can score only by placing
the ball inside the goal of the opposite team.
Teams content 11 players – field players and a
goalkeeper. The goalkeeper’s role is to protect
the goal. He’s the only person that can touch
the ball with his hands, but only in his penalty
area. There are also 3 men which are not
playing, these are the refferees.<br>
                
Personally I play football for both training and
fun. Many contacts with the ball improve the
technique, and moving on the pitch builds the
condition. Additionaly scoring a goal or
blocking a dangerous shot is a really nice
feeling, what makes football a good game for
minimizing the stress. It’s good to have an onfield idol, that you can watch to improve your
skills. My idol is Kaka’, because I love the way
he dribbles and passes.
